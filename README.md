# Space_B__ars
This is a game made on Python, and runs on the PyGame libraries. 

All the rogue keys have escaped your keyboard, except the loyal Space_bar.
Use the Space Bar to capture all of the other keys. Remember, if you try to capture an already captured key, it will escape, and so, avoid capturing the space bar at all costs.
The keys that you have captured can be used to form commands, which help you capture the other keys. So, you could use the command "slow" to slow down the stream of characters. And yes, even to save the game, use the command "save".

The main idea behind the game is to be an expansive user modded game. Thus, one of the goals is to have a large list of commands that the user can execute.
Some of the commands that have been thought of are - protect, reverse, slow, save, etc.
The player will not be knowing which all commands exist in the game, but rather be expected to try out the different words that can be formed with the available keys, and see what happens and works.

The project highly encourages any contributions, in any form - graphics, sounds, game commands, or code contributions. All suggestions, bug reports and idea contributions are welcome in the discussions.
